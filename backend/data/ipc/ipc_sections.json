Explanation 2 .—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abett ed should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.

B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation.

Illustrations (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a p erson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death . (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he ma y not have intended to cause Z's death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular i ndividual. Exception 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos: — First .—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Thirdly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation .—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. 74 (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a publi c servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does no t believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of p rivate defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, an d kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defe nce. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is caused. Exception 4 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation .—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5 .—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has there fore abetted murder.",

Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bulloc k in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A ha s committed theft of the treasure. (d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft. (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a wa rehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occup ies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. (g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not ven turing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is hig hly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it w hen the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his ow n property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intentio n of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impressio n, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and cl othes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give aw ay alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property d ishonestly, he commits theft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.",

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B tha t Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. (b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. (c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payabl e to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted i n the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand r upees. A commits forgery. (d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, s igned by A, without inserting the sum payable and aut horizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees fo r the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. (e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a ge nuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A i s guilty of forgery. (f) Z's will contains these words —“I direct that all my remaining property be equally div ided between A, B and C. ” A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery . (g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payab le to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order ” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the wor ds “Pay to Z or his order ”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a b lank endorsement. B commits forgery. (h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in orde r to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of t he same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. (i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes dow n a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign th e will. A has committed forgery. (j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good characte r and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. H ere, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. (k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending ther eby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to d eceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express o r implied contract for service. Explanation 1.—A man ’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. Illustrations (a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by an other person of the same name. A has committed forgery. (b) A writes the word “accepted ” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in orde r that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of fo rgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. (c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bil l in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committe d forgery. (d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decre e against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in co llusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure , with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before th e seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own n ame, commits forgery by antedating it. (e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to de fraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory no te binding himself to pay to B a sum for value receive d, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery un der the first head of the definition. Explanation 2 .—The making of a false document in the name of a fictiou s person, intending it to be believed that the docume nt was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, in tending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. Illustration A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fi ctitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery. 1[Explanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing 2[electronic signature] ” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause ( d) of sub-section ( 1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000) .]",
